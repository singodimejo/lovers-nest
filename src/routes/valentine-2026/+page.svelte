        Dearest, Maya
        
        Two years have passed since I last wrote to you here.
        The last time, I gave you a faux choice as a form of jest.
        This year, I have no desire to do so.

        I longingly await your arrival in my embrace so that I may feel your warmth.
        I yearn for the opportunity to gaze upon your beauty with my own eyes.
        I have a question that have kept me from rest.
        You must make haste and relieve me from my burden.
        
        Tell me sincerely my love
        Will you be my valentine?

        Write back to me so that I may sleep and dream of your love once more.

        Lovingly yours,
        Aam

            We will see each other soon
            Do. Not. Bathe.
